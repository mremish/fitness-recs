The focus of this project was to develop a personalized fitness recommendation system that provides tailored feedback for individuals as they progress towards an exercise routine based on metrics such as heart rate, daily steps, and sleep quality. The goal of this system as it develops is to encourage individuals to meet fitness goals based on their needs and personal progress in their unique health journeys to promote a healthier lifestyle.


**Some questions in mind when approaching this project:**

What health-related metrics heavily influence people on their weight loss and general health journeys?

How should these unique metrics be prioritized when creating a fitness plan?

What is the long-term impact of having a personalized fitness plan on physical and mental health?

How can machine learning be used to inform our model?


**Key stakeholders:**

Current fitness market: Individuals currently in the fitness industry through gyms, sports, or community leagues would be target recipients of these recommendations because they have clearer goals and intentions when it comes to their fitness journey

Competitive landscape: Target companies, such as Fitbit and Garmin, refine their products with advanced analytical features to keep up with customer demand, making them competitors in a personalized recommendation

Aspiring members: Those not in the market, either as competitors or individuals, are stakeholders to target in hopes of expanding the consumer base to as many unique audiences as possible, maximizing the attraction towards the system
